## Project 1

**Make a data frame**


From [The World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) construct a data frame in which units (rows) are world countries with names from the "book" and variables (columns):
  - the first variable **V1** contains the two-character code of the country [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) - for labels in visualizations;
  - the second, third, fourth, and fifth variables are as given in the table  (select a row from the table and **send me an e-mail for confirmation** **or** select your variables **V2**, **V3**, **V4**, and **V5** for which you expect that are somehow related, and **send me an e-mail for confirmation**). Try to avoid variables with many missing values; 
  - if you find it useful for your exploration you can add additional variables from the "book".

To make variables comparable, you can select also derived variables such as (Labor force / Population), (Annual passenger traffic on registered air carriers / Population), or (Total airports / Land area).

The list of available variables can be seen from a description of the selected country - for example [Italy](Italy-Factbook.pdf). Here is also a [world map](world_pol.pdf).

For visual inspection, the additional variable **region** (North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia, East & Southeast Asia, Australia & Oceania, Antarctica) would be very useful. This partition can be constructed from the region's countries lists [1](https://github.com/bavla/HSE/raw/refs/heads/master/EDA/Regions1.zip) [2]([Regions2.zip](https://github.com/bavla/HSE/raw/refs/heads/master/EDA/Regions2.zip)).

**Save** the created data frame as a CSV file.

**Explore** the collected data. For visualization on a map see [Maps](notes:rmap) or [rworldmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rworldmap/).

**Write** a report and save it as a PDF file. **Put** the report and CSV file into a ZIP file and **send it** to me.

**Hint:** The ''factbook'' data (for the year 2020) are available as a JSON file at [GitHub](https://github.com/iancoleman/cia_world_factbook_api#data) / [Download](https://github.com/iancoleman/cia_world_factbook_api/raw/master/data/factbook.json)

```
> library(jsonlite)
> J <- fromJSON(readLines("factbook.json"))
> str(J,max.level=2)
> J$countries[[4]]$data$name
[1] "Albania"
> J$countries$albania$data$name
[1] "Albania"
> names(J$countries)
> names(J$countries$albania$data)
```

## Project 2

The [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) Dataset is a comprehensive, open-source bibliographic database offering extensive information on academic publications.

The data can be accessed using API that can be used from a web browser or user programs. [How to use API in R?](http://vladowiki.fmf.uni-lj.si/doku.php?id=vlado:work:bib:alex:r1)

### Select an institution

**Select** an institution with at least 25000 published works. To prevent duplication, **send** me its OpenAlex ID for confirmation.

For example, for [https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=HSE](https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=HSE) and [https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=Univerza v Ljubljani](https://api.openalex.org/institutions?search=Univerza%20v%20Ljubljani) we get IDs [I118501908](https://openalex.org/I118501908) (works_count: 45987) and [I153976015](https://openalex.org/I153976015) (works_count: 64266). Both are OK.

|   n  |  student   |  ID  |  institution                  |  
|------|------|-------|-------|   
|   1    |     |     |        | 
|  15    |     |     |        | 


 

### Task 1

For the selected institution in the years 2011-2021, **list** names of the top 10 units (total values) and **draw** the frequency distribution by years of the top unit and the joint distribution of all units of the following variables
  - number of works of an author in a given year
  - fractional contribution of an author in a given year
  - number of works of an author in a given year written in collaboration with at least one author from **other** Country

A fractional contribution of an author to a given work is 1/(number of authors). A fractional contribution of an author to a given set of works is the sum of the fractional contributions of works from a given set.

For example. Assume that author A wrote in the year 2015 three works a: 1, b: 5, c: 2 (numbers count authors). Then A's fractional contribution for the year 2015 is 1 + 1/5 + 1/2 = 1.7.

For authors from the selected institution in the years 2011-2021, **create** a data frame (author's OpenAlex ID, author's name, total number of works, total fractional contribution, total number of works with foreigners) and **save** it in CSV format.

### Task 2

For the selected institution draw the corresponding picture of the type

<img src="https://github.com/bavla/EDA/blob/main/24/numauths.png" width="500">

red - proportion of single-author works, blue - proportion of works with 2 authors, etc.



**Interpret** the obtained results.

## Project 3
**Explore a large data set**\


There are many data sets available: [planes](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays), [taxi](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [Data world](https://data.world/),[European Social Survey](http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/), [V-dem](https://www.v-dem.net/en/data/data/v-party-dataset/), [Pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/tools-and-resources/),[Food data](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/download-datasets.html), ..., **your own source**. Explore the **selected** data set: select variables and
explore them (distribution, extreme values, ...), explore relations among variables (pairs, clustering, regression, derived quantities, 
interesting observations), and ideas for detailed analyses. **Report** your findings.

The selected data set has to have at least  10000 units or in the case of temporal data set the product Number of units X âˆš(Number of time points) is at least 10000.

**Before starting the analysis** send me an e-mail about your selection for confirmation.\
